# DCMF

This code is a python implementation of the DCMF algorithm proposed in  
[Fast Mining of a Network of Coevolving Time Series](http://ycai.ws.gc.cuny.edu/files/2015/03/NoT_sdm15.pdf)

[Motes dataset](http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html)

Please NOTE that this repository was created for my personal use.  
You should contact the authors to get the original code of the DCMF.
